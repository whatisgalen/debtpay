# debtpay
Program to assist users in paying the least amount of interest possible during their total dept repayment.

# What is this program?
Imagine you've got 3 debts:

$3000 student debts (at 6% interest)

$5000 carloan (at 2.5% interest)

$7500 personal loan (at 1.75%)

You know you've only got $500 each month to throw at your debt. How big of a monthly payment do you make to each?

This program takes the details of up to 3 debts as inputs, as well as some amount of monthly discretionary budget, and then tells
you exactly what portion of that amount to spend on each debt. Don't listen to the "Snowball" gurus or the "pay off in order of
descending interest" hacks. Trust the math.
